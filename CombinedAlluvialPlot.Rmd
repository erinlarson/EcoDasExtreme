## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r dataread}
EEdata<-read.csv("EEData.csv")
```

```{r data manip}
EEdata$Type_system_broad <- factor(rep(NA,length(EEdata$Type_system)),
                                   levels=c("freshwater","coastal","marine"))
EEdata$Type_system_broad[EEdata$Type_system %in% c("catchment/watershed","floodplain","lake","pond","stream/river","wetland")] <- "freshwater"
EEdata$Type_system_broad[EEdata$Type_system %in% c("estuary","lagoon","marine intertidal")] <- "coastal" 
# question if "coastal ocean" is coastal or marine - the only paper in this category looked at subtidal algae beds
EEdata$Type_system_broad[EEdata$Type_system %in% c("coastal ocean","deep sea","open ocean")] <- "marine"
# given there are so few marine events, maybe better to combine coastal and marine categories

EEdata$ProximateEvent_Type_broad <- factor(rep(NA,length(EEdata$ProximateEvent_Type)),
                                           levels=c("Flood","Drought","Heatwave","Other"))
EEdata$ProximateEvent_Type_broad[EEdata$ProximateEvent_Type %in% c("Flood")] <- "Flood"
EEdata$ProximateEvent_Type_broad[EEdata$ProximateEvent_Type %in% c("Drought")] <- "Drought"
EEdata$ProximateEvent_Type_broad[EEdata$ProximateEvent_Type %in% c("Heatwave")] <- "Heatwave"
EEdata$ProximateEvent_Type_broad[is.na(EEdata$ProximateEvent_Type_broad)] <- "Other"
```
## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r data summarize, echo=FALSE}
EEdatasum <- EEdata_min %>%
    group_by(UniqueAccession, Type_system, ProximateEvent_Type, BiologicalResponseMeasured, PhysicalResponse_ParameterMeasured, ChemicalResponse_ElementMaterial_Measured) %>%
    summarize()
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
