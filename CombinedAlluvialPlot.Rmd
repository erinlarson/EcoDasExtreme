## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r dataread}
EEdata<-read.csv("EEData.csv")
```

Manipulating the system type and event type.
```{r eventinfo}
EEdata$Type_system_broad <- factor(rep(NA,length(EEdata$Type_system)),
                                   levels=c("freshwater","coastal","marine"))
EEdata$Type_system_broad[EEdata$Type_system %in% c("catchment/watershed","floodplain","lake","pond","stream/river","wetland")] <- "freshwater"
EEdata$Type_system_broad[EEdata$Type_system %in% c("estuary","lagoon","marine intertidal")] <- "coastal" 
# question if "coastal ocean" is coastal or marine - the only paper in this category looked at subtidal algae beds
EEdata$Type_system_broad[EEdata$Type_system %in% c("coastal ocean","deep sea","open ocean")] <- "marine"
# given there are so few marine events, maybe better to combine coastal and marine categories

EEdata$ProximateEvent_Type_broad <- factor(rep(NA,length(EEdata$ProximateEvent_Type)),
                                           levels=c("Flood","Drought","Heatwave","Other"))
EEdata$ProximateEvent_Type_broad[EEdata$ProximateEvent_Type %in% c("Flood")] <- "Flood"
EEdata$ProximateEvent_Type_broad[EEdata$ProximateEvent_Type %in% c("Drought")] <- "Drought"
EEdata$ProximateEvent_Type_broad[EEdata$ProximateEvent_Type %in% c("Heatwave")] <- "Heatwave"
EEdata$ProximateEvent_Type_broad[is.na(EEdata$ProximateEvent_Type_broad)] <- "Other"
```

Manipulating the biological response variable.
```{r biovar}
EEdata$OrgLevel <- factor(rep(NA,length(EEdata$BiologicalResponseMeasured)),
                                   levels=c("population", "community", "ecosystem"))

EEdata$OrgLevel[EEdata$BiologicalResponseMeasured %in% c("annual biomass","aboveground biomass","belowground biomass","biomass","summer biomass", "EVI")] <- "ecosystem"

EEdata$OrgLevel[EEdata$BiologicalResponseMeasured %in% c("abundance","annual abundance", "catches or landings", "density", "percent occurrence", "occupancy rate", "percent cover", "summer abundance", "annual Year of Young", "summer Year of Young", "population size structure",  "male survival", "reproduction - nest quantity", "reproduction - ovulation rate", "reproduction - young survival", "body condition", "diet", "growth",  "infection rate", "leaf carbon isotope ratio", "metabolism", "mortality", "ratio of leaf chlorophyl a:b", "rhizome starch levels", "rhizome sugar level", "seawater readiness", "stomach fullness", "stress - cortisol level", "total leaf chlorophyl", "behavior - movement", "carbon assimilation")] <- "population"


EEdata$OrgLevel[EEdata$BiologicalResponseMeasured %in% c("annual evenness", "annual richness", "diversity", "functional beta diversity", "functional community structure","phenotypic diversity", "species evenness", "species richness", "summer evenness", "summer richness", "taxonomic beta diversity", "taxonomic diversity", "taxonomic richness", "macroinvertebrate community index", "community composition", "foodweb structure",  "taxonomic community structure", "stability and persistence", "colonization rate", "extinction rate")] <- "community"

```

```{r chemphysmanip}

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r data summarize, echo=FALSE}
EEdatasum <- EEdata_min %>%
    group_by(UniqueAccession, Type_system, ProximateEvent_Type, BiologicalResponseMeasured, PhysicalResponse_ParameterMeasured, ChemicalResponse_ElementMaterial_Measured) %>%
    summarize()
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
